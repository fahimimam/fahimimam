Hey there, I'm Fahim! 👋

👨‍💻 I’m currently working as a backend developer with a passion for developing elegant and efficient solutions to complex problems. I specialize in GoLang and have experience working in a Fintech company. In addition to GoLang, I have experience with web development technologies such as JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Express.js and Node.js.

🌱 I'm currently learning more about microservices and distributed systems to broaden my skill set and take on more challenging projects.

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to finance, or projects that aim to solve challenging real-world problems using technology.

💬 Ask me about my experience working in the Fintech industry, or any programming-related questions! I'm always happy to help and share knowledge.
